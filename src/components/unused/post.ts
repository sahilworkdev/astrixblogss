          "In a significant policy shift, Donald Trump, after being sworn in as the 47th President of the United States, signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, to formally withdraw the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO). The decision was justified on grounds of the WHO's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic, its alleged failure to implement necessary reforms, and what Trump described as `unfair financial burdens` on the US compared to other member states, particularly China.",

WHO's budget for 2024-2025 is estimated at $6.8 billion, with the next-largest contributors being the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, followed by organizations like Gavi, the European Commission, and the World Bank. The largest national donor after the US is Germany, which contributes around 3% of WHO's budget.",

Former WHO chief scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan described the move as a regressive step for global health, warning that it would hamper the US's ability to influence global health policies and access critical data. The decision is not unprecedented, as Trump had previously attempted to pull out of the WHO during his first term in 2020, alleging that the organization aided China in misleading the world about the origins of COVID-19. However, the withdrawal was halted when Joe Biden assumed office and rejoined the WHO on his first day in office in 2021.",
